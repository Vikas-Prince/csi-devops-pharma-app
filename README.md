# Enterprise-Grade DevSecOps Platform for Pharmaceutical Java Application

## Project Overview

This repository is part of a comprehensive enterprise-grade DevSecOps platform designed to deploy a Java-based pharmaceutical application on Azure using cloud-native best practices. The goal is to replicate real-world enterprise deployment workflows by integrating modern CI/CD, GitOps, security scanning, infrastructure automation, and monitoring tools into a unified, scalable, and secure platform.

---

## Architecture & Setup Overview

The platform follows an industry-standard **GitFlow branching strategy** ‚Äî including **develop, release, main, feature** with support for multiple environments ‚Äî **development (dev), quality assurance (qa), staging (pre prod), production (prod)** ‚Äî along with disaster recovery (DR) and optional user acceptance testing (UAT) branches for major features. 

The deployment lifecycle includes:
- Automated infrastructure provisioning via Terraform
- Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines with Maven, unit testing, Trivy(filesystem and Image) and static/dynamic security scanning
- Container image management and artifact storage
- Pull Request (PR) mechanism to update Docker image tags in the GitOps repository, enabling controlled, auditable deployments 
- GitOps-driven Continuous Deployment (CD) with ArgoCD and Kustomize overlays
- Canary deployment strategy for safe progressive rollouts
- Enterprise-grade monitoring and observability at both cluster and application levels
- Notification and alerting integration for real-time feedback


For details on the **branching strategy** and **pipeline architecture**, refer to the documentation:

## Repository Structure

## üìÅ Repository Structure

To maintain clear separation of concerns, the platform is divided into **three distinct repositories**:

| Repository Name               | Purpose                                                                                                                                           | Maintained By                  | Repository Link                                                                 |

## High-Level Workflow Summary

1. **Development**: Developers work on feature branches following GitFlow strategy.
2. **CI Pipeline**: Code changes trigger GitHub Actions for build, test, security scans, and container image builds.
3. **Artifact Publishing**: Docker images are pushed to Azure Container Registry; binaries are stored in Nexus.
4. **GitOps Deployment**: The CI pipeline updates the GitOps repo with new image tags, which ArgoCD automatically syncs to AKS clusters based on environment overlays.
5. **Progressive Rollouts**: Canary deployment strategy ensures safe deployment through dev, qa, staging, and production environments.
6. **Monitoring & Alerts**: Prometheus, Grafana, and Application Insights provide comprehensive observability and alerting; Slack notifications keep teams informed.
